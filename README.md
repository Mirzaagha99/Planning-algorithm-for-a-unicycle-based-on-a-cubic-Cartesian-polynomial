# Planning-algorithm-for-a-unicycle-based-on-a-cubic-Cartesian-polynomial
The aim of this project is to realize a planning algorithm for a unicycle based on a cubic Cartesian polynomial. The robot must be brought from the configuration $q_i$= [0 0 0$]^T$ to $q_f$= [4 1 $\pi \over 2$ $]^T$. Then it has been terminated a timing law over the path to satisfy the following velocity bounds |v(t)| ≤1 m/s and |$\omega$(t)| ≤ 1 rad/s.

In the pdf: "cubic Cartesian polynomial.pdf" the analysis made is explained in detail.
